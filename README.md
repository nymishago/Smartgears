          <h3>This is our Robot.</h3>
					  <p>Our robot looks like this...</p>
						<p> Our robot uses these attachments. </p>
						  <h4>  We do___ missions in ____ runs. Our most most consistent mission/run is _____.  <h4>
                   <h4> Run 1 </h4>
                   <p>We added drop in attachments on both sides so the robot didn't have to turn</p>

 # What We Learned
    We reviewed how to line align
    We learned how to make a my block
    We learned how to use the green and orange blocks
 		We learned how to make a gear box 
 		#Our Robot Design Philosophy
		We wanted to make a robot that made attachment changes quick and easy
 	 	We made our robot square so we could use a jig
  	We connected each program to one master program 
   # Our Mission Strategy
     In our first run we saw that there were two missions next to eachother and close to base
 		 We did the missions that were close to each other in one run to save time
